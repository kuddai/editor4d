work in progress!

# TODO
* pass indices and vertices from js client
* pass rotation planes angles from js
* modify opengl/shader code to account for indices and worldprojection matrices
* add barycentric buffer generation to geometry class (questionable - so far not convinced that geometry class needed as it has only one usefull method - project)
* add transparency support into shader (src https://github.com/kuddai/webgl2examples/blob/master/oit.html). It will require abstracting shader/opengl work into separate class.
